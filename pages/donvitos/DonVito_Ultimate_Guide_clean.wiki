Race & Class Story, Game-Play, & Stereotypes



Slayer Race



Slayers were formed by E.V.E; “Elite Vampire Exterminators”. The title Slayers was formed by the Vampire Race when they realized that an elite number of Human beings were slaying younger Vampires. Slayers are known to almost never be alone. They seem much weaker when they fight alone, but when grouped with different classes Slayers fight much better and have the ability to work together to eliminate the most dangerous threat in the world of Helena. A group of Slayers is known as “The Unstoppable Force” by Vampires, which is why these predators lure & seduce Slayers to be alone as much as possible.



Vampire Race

Vampires, the unholy beings, multiply day & night and have an outstanding ability to resist the light. Gilles, Tepes & Bathory, Lords of the Vampires, started infecting Human beings and those who were infected & transformed were off on missions to infect others with demonic blood. Vampires are known to usually be alone most of the time. They have an arsenal of skills to survive the harshest conditions. Vampires do not have souls, and thus, they do not use MP / EP (Ousters MP) instead, they use their own blood. They regenerate their HP in a very rapid rate and can suck the blood from monsters if they need HP.



Ouster Race

Ousters were born when peace was found between a Male Slayer & a Female Vampire. This couple grew fond of each other, shared their views of the perfect worlds and went off to leave technology & demonic rituals to find a place of peace & nature. This couple made love and after a while in a cave, the Vampire gave birth to a very unusual relic that resembled a human. From the shock of the vampire giving birth to an inanimate object, the Slayer ran and was charged with treason and was executed. The female Vampire was left alone with the relic and decided to revert back to her unholy traditions. Right when she was about to cast an unholy spell to seal the cave, the relic radiated with luminous light and exploded into millions of pods with live female fetuses that later grew to be fully developed & powerful women. The vampire was killed by the explosion & so Ousters were born.  Ousters are always out numbered but the force of nature & the superior genetics allows them to become stronger than both slayers & vampires alone. They live up to a promise to bring peace and avenge their parents, even if it means to kill other Vampires & Slayers mercilessly with their higher understanding of Elemental Magic & Physical Force.

Slayer Classes



The Defender

The Defender is usually the front line warrior. With quick reflexes, the ability to control lightning & a shield to protect them from attacks they are known to be the most well rounded Slayer. Defenders are usually in the front lines of battles directing & protecting his group.



Advantages:

-Fast Attacks, which allows the Defender to change tactics quickly.

-Good Defense, which gives the Defender a chance to avoid more physical attacks

-Good Protection, which allows the Defender to endure more physical damage

-High HP, for longer longevity in the battlefield

-Good Critical Rate, this means you have a higher chance of doing 150%-250% (Proven & Tested) of the normal damage & knocking back your enemy at a much higher rate with your main skill, Infinity Thunder Bolt.



Disadvantages:

- Low To-Hit, due to the fast pace tactics, the Defender has a harder time to focus on the accuracy of the attacks

- Average Damage, due to the fast pace tactics, the Defender has a harder time to output strong, heavy attacks like the Splitter



Typical Builds of a Defender



Dexterity Based Defender – 400~500 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: High To-Hit & Evasion

Disadvantages: Lower HP & Protection, & Slightly Lower Damage

“I highly recommend this build for Defenders. After you get promoted to 151 you will have the ability to freely distribute status points. Add 300-400 Dexterity & the rest to Strength. This is one of my favorite slayers to play since they have great skills, speed & if built correctly, survivability & accuracy which is what a melee should all be about”



Strength Based Defender – 200 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: High HP & Protection, & Slightly Higher Damage

Disadvantages: Low To-Hit & Evasion

Preferred Set

1) Curse Resistance 120+, All Resistance 50+, 8-~12+ HP Steal, 3~5 MP Steal

2) Damage & To Hit for same race PvP

Slayer Classes



The Splitter

The Splitter is usually the most valuable damage dealer. They have the ability to make every attack count because the damage & effectiveness of the attack is so high. They stand in the frontlines ready to take on any challenge. They are found to be in the front lines along side with the Defender, making up for the Damage.



Advantages:

-Powerful Attacks, which allows the Splitter to cleave through the enemies HP

-Good Defense, which gives the Splitter a chance to avoid more physical attacks

-Good Protection, which allows the Splitter to endure more physical damage

-High HP, for longer longevity in the battlefield

-Decent To-Hit, because the Splitter has a much slower attack speed rate, they are able to focus on their targets more



Disadvantages:

- Very Slow, due to the heavy damage, the swing of the giant blade slows the Splitter down

- High MP Consumption, MP exhausts quickly due to the strong force of the skills the Splitter uses

Typical Builds of a Splitter



Dexterity Based Splitter – 400~500 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: Very High To-Hit & Evasion

Disadvantages: Lower HP, Protection, & Slightly Lower Damage



Strength Based Splitter – 200 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: Very High HP & Protection, & Slightly Higher Damage

Disadvantages: Lower To-Hit & Evasion



Preferred Set

1) Curse Resistance 120+, All Resistance 50+, 8-~12+ HP Steal, 9~10 MP Steal

2) Damage & To Hit for same race PvP

“I never really liked Splitters; the game-play style is not my type. They hit really hard, but way too slow for me, and the MP usage is insane. For the most, Dexterity Builds are mainly for PvP, and Strength Based builds are for PvM, so make your choice. I would prefer the Dexterity Based build because I hate missing”



Slayer Classes



The Bishop

Bishops are saints blessed with magical powers discovered by the powerful sages who worked with E.V.E. They have the ability to give life to dead Slayers, resist & cure all sorts of demonic curses, and the ability to support the group by using mystical healing skills and powerful magical spells. Bishops are found in the middle lines of combat supporting the back & front lines with magical attacks. They may be found even in front of the Splitter & Defenders at advanced stages. Although this class may be powerful, they will almost always depend on others for assistance to attain levels quickly.



Advantages:

-Powerful Magical Attacks, which poison the blood of Vampires & Ousters with Silver, which blocks their HP from regenerating past the Silver infected HP

-Healing Spells, Ability to Regenerate HP quickly & survive longer

-Increased Resistance, of Vampires demonic curses

-Outstanding Magical Resistance, Denial Magic allows the Bishop to be the last survivor versus any type of mage

- Highest Survivability, if built & played correctly

- One of the most feared Slayer classes, due to the arsenal of skills

- Unstoppable with the help of a Granter – Video to prove it:



Disadvantages:

- Very Slow & Bad Versus Monsters, the skills provided for the healer aren’t the strongest versus monsters

- Dependence on Others, you will almost always be in parties if you want to level effectively

Typical Builds of a Bishop



Intelligence Based Bishop – All Intelligence

Advantages:  Higher Magical Damage

Disadvantages: Horrible Survivability, Low HP, Low Protection



Strength Based Bishop – All Strength

Advantages: High HP & High Protection

Disadvantages: Lower Magical Damage



Slayer Classes



The Bishop



“This is my favorite class. It requires a lot of work & patience but this class is bound to be the best in PvP versus other races... I highly urge and recommend you to play this class only as a Strength Based Bishop”



“A very important note to all future Bishops; on high rate servers, you may just want to level with a cross and add all your attribute points to strength. On Low – Mid rate servers, you will have to party with other members, wear a sword and shield and let others attack to increase your base STR. When you attack, you will raise INT. You will have to find a way to balance this and keep your STR as high as you can but with enough INT for MP & for it not to level so quickly.



Preferred Set

1) Curse Resistance 100+ / All Resistance 70+, 8-~12+ HP Steal, 3~4 MP Steal



Slayer Classes



The Granter

Granters are saints blessed with magical powers discovered by the powerful sages who worked with E.V.E. They are the ultimate support of all Slayers. They have the ability to see through Darkness, Increase Physical Damage, Defense, Protection, and HP & MP and they have outstanding Magical Damage.

Granters are found in the middle lines of combat supporting the back & front lines with magical attacks. They are also found soloing most of the time in advanced stages.



Advantages:

-Powerful Magical Attacks, which poison the blood of Vampires & Ousters with Silver, which blocks their HP from regenerating past the Silver infected HP

-Rotten Apple, Level 150 Skill, “One Rotten Apple Ruins the Whole Batch”.

This skill allows a Granter to kill off any monster close to another monster that has nearly no HP left with just one click. Making the Granter one of the best Solo characters

-Fame, fame gets you the good items. Rotten Apple kills high level monsters in 1 hit so you will be able to build up your fame higher than any other class in the server.

-Effective in PvM, due to the high Magical Damage & Rotten Apple, you will be able to kill anything with very little effort. This depends in your game-play style.

- Highest Survivability, if built & played correctly

- Unstoppable with the help of a Bishop

- Best In-Game Buffs & De-Buffs



Disadvantages:

-Inability to Survive Long Without Aura Shield, Aura shield allows the Granter to use his spirit instead of his body to defend him, which means the MP will get damaged instead. If your MP depletes your aura shield will be off and you are open to most attacks that will hurt & possibly kill the Granter very quickly.

-Requires Professional Players, this is truly a class made only for the pro’s or people that are willing to fail A LOT before being able to become decent at playing as a Granter



Slayer Classes



The Granter

Typical Builds of a Granter



Intelligence Based Granter – All Intelligence

Advantages:  Higher Magical Damage, Higher MP, High MP Regeneration

Disadvantages: Horrible Survivability without Aura Shield



“This is one of the most confusing but effective classes I have played on Slayers. This is one of my least favorite classes due to the fragility of the character at low levels. With enough leveling & dedication, this will be one of the strongest classes in the entire game even against other slayers”

Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 120+, All Resistance 50+, 3~5+ HP Steal, 6~7+ MP Steal



Slayer Classes



The Heavy Shooter

E.V.E started off with this very class. They are the foundation of the Slayers army.

Heavy Shooters are the marksmen of the Slayer Race, and have the ability to use powerful Submachine Guns, Fully Automatic Rifles, Sniper Rifles, or Shotguns.

Heavy Shooters are found at the back of the combat lines shooting their enemies from a long distance with deadly force, speed & accuracy and with enough cover to protect them from their fragility.



Advantages:

-Powerful Attacks, which poison the blood of Vampires & Ousters with Silver, which blocks their HP from regenerating past the silver infected HP if the Heavy Shooter uses Silver Bullets

-Very High Critical Rate this means you have a higher chance of doing 150%-250% (Proven & Tested) of the normal damage & knocking back your enemy at a much higher rate with your skills

-Turret Form, Heavy Shooters can build an immobile turret and fire from it, giving them a great increase to physical & magical resistance and also increasing their damage, critical rate, HP/MP Steal rate drastically. They will also not be effected by the vision loss that is caused by Darkness

-Highest Defense, amongst other slayers



Disadvantages:

-Low HP, the low HP is the reason why gunners are not popular. They depend solely on their gear & defense to protect them from physical & magical damage.



Typical Builds of a Heavy Shooter



Dexterity Based Heavy Shooter – All Dexterity

Advantages:  Higher Defense & To-Hit

Disadvantages: Lower HP, Protection and Damage



Strength Based Heavy Shooter – 400-500 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: Higher HP, Protection, and Damage

Disadvantages: Lower Defense &, To-Hit

“I really dislike this class the most. They have the lowest survivability in the battle field and are more of a support class for damage .A very fun class to play as a beginner”

Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 110+, All Resistance 60+, 4-~10+ HP Steal, 2~5 MP Steal

Vampire Classes



Melee Vampire Noble

Gilles De Raise, the Head Lord of the Vampire Council was the ultimate melee vampire. He trained ever since he had lust for blood and immortality. Through his years of experience, he recognized that the ultimate weapon for a vampire would be their own body. A Melee vampire focuses on using their rage, hatred & pity to eliminate all in their path. These Vampires use basic tactics to overcome their threats and to endure Slayer’s destructiveness.



Typical Melee Vampire Noble Builds



Dexterity Based Melee Vampire Noble - 100~200 Strength, Rest Dexterity

Advantages: High Defense, High To-Hit

Disadvantages:  Average Damage, Low HP, Very weak against Mage Enemies.

“A Pure Dexterity Based Vampire was my least favorite type of Melee Vampire Noble class to play. The Defense & To-Hit was very high which was amazing for PvP but every hit that did land on it would hurt twofold. I think that the best type of character would have a good balance between Strength and Dexterity. With at least 200 Strength, I believe that this Melee Vampire Noble would be a well-rounded rounded character”



Strength Based Melee Vampire Noble - 100~300 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: High Damage, High HP, High Protection

Disadvantages: Low To-Hit, Low Defense

“These types of Vampire Noble’s are a very great alternative to go, hunt items, and kill higher level monsters. They make a great distracting and front line defense, and are just brutal versus mages. The lack of To-Hit really put me off but with the Vampire Curse: Mephistopheles, a Vampire’s To-Hit increases quite significantly. With the right amount of Dexterity & Strength, dedication to leveling & a good, set this would be one of the best characters in the game”



“A professional Melee Vampire Noble uses all the skills he can, even magical ones. Although they may not be as effective as a Mage Vampire, they still can save the vampire from Holy or Silver Infected or even Elemental magic. The Darkness Skill is a good way to avoid these attacks by concealing yourself into dust. The Meteor Strike skill is very difficult to cast with low intelligence, but with enough determination, you can use it to kill off high defense characters.

Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100 / All Resistance 60+, 20+ HP Steal



Vampire Classes



Mage Vampire Noble

Bathory, the evil witch Vampire had a very fragile body but her soul & thoughts were far more corrupt than anyone else’s, and this is what gave her the advantage in the battle field. Taking advantage of her cursed mind, rituals and spirit she developed the strongest, most fearsome kinds of Magic. She used all kinds of treacherous elements such as Curses, Poisons, Acids, Blood & hell-bound elements to make any Slayer in her path flee from the filth & destruction of her fury. Vampires that lusted for blood & destruction followed her path.



Typical Melee Vampire Noble Builds



Dexterity Based Mage Vampire Noble

240 Dexterity, Rest Intelligence to at least 500 & some Strength in later levels

Advantages: High Defense, Very Versatile Character, Low Cool Down on Skills

Disadvantages:  Requires Professional Players, Average Magical Damage

“This is my specialty out of all the Vampire Noble categories. They can do anything, and they can be immortal by playing cheap tactics. This is the perfect character for those who really like versatility in skills & tactics & teasing their enemies. This type of Vampire is as good as the player, literally. Some characters like Slayers have preset tactics, but these types of Vampires don’t, which makes them very hard to predict. It stands no chance against a large party of slayers, but it is one of the most outstanding PvM and 1:1 PvP characters”

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHwRCol3tgA&feature=related



Intelligence Based Vampire - All Intelligence

Advantages: High Magical Damage, Highly Effective Magical Spells

Disadvantages: Low Defense, Low Protection, Low HP, Low Survivability, High Cool Down on Skills

“This type of Vampire is my least favorite. The reason being is that sooner or later, your damage will reach a maximum & people will develop sets that were made to be against your main skills; Resistance Sets. They perform the best when the server is new, but at higher levels & later staged in the server they will be very vulnerable. Your main target is 500 Intelligence, and you can get that with the Dexterity Based Mage Vampire Noble if you level enough. You will probably give up on this character before you reach a very high level because the survivability is horrible in PvP & PvM.



Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100+ / All Resistance 60+, 20+ HP Steal

Ouster Classes

Fire Ouster

Ousters that were born into nature blessed their bodies, minds, souls with the elements that suited their personalities the best. Fire Ousters are extremely aggressive & impatient like the Fire Goddess, Miga. The burning passion of revenge is like in inferno in their hearts and the rage will never stop for their betrayal from both Vampires & Slayers. Fire Ousters specialize in magical attacks that spread like wild fire & burn their victims mercilessly. These ousters deal the most damage out of all because they have 5-6 skills that deal mostly deal damage over time.



Advantages:

Highest Damage Output In the Game:

This Ousters dishes out so much damage because of the following:

Beat head + Magnum Spear Combo = Approximately 550 Damage/Combo

Ring of Flare = 40~70 Damage/Hit

Fire Elemental = 60 Damage/Hit

Prominence: 2000+ Damage over time

Hell Fire: 1600+ Damage over time

Fierce Flame: 850 Damage over time

Levels the Fastest

Solo Character: Do not need to depend on anyone for basic leveling or PvP



Disadvantages:

Complex Game-Play: Between keeping your buffs up, building right tactics versus each character & attacking, it gets messy if you’re new to the game

Low survivability without RA: Reactive Armor cuts all incoming damage in half. Now that you have no damage modifier…surviving will be a lot harder

Darkness: Darkness screws over a Fire Ouster the most, most of their important attacks are single target, and when a Vampire hides from them, vampires will have a greater chance of avoiding all your attacks.

Silver Intake: Silver Intake is very painful. Slayers will fill your HP with silver very quickly causing you to loose precious HP in the battle field

Complex Set: These are the worse characters to build a set for. You NEED high HPS, EPS, All Resistance and Curse Resistance to play comfortably



Ouster Classes

Fire Ouster

Typical Fire Ouster Builds



Non-RA Hybrid Fire Ouster

(This is the only type I will cover, because RA is fixed on this server)

400 Intelligence, ½ Dexterity & ½ Strength (100/100. 150/150. 200/200)



Advantages: High Magical Damage, Good Defense,, Can be great at PvP & PvM, can train at harder areas at night

Disadvantages: - Requires High Level Players, Low HP, Low Protection



“These types of Ousters are very complicated to play. Fortunately, these are my favorite & most of the time, the only Ouster I ever make. They have an amazing capability of surviving great because of Ring of Flare that steals HP. They have amazing damage at 400 INT. They are simply the most feared class second to none. They are victims of Darkness & Yellow poison though, which makes a DEX/INT Vampire their main threat. A healer will be very hard to defeat without RA as well. If you build your character right and follow the proper skill tree, I believe you would be able to defeat healers but it will be a long fight.



Non-RA Strength Fire Ouster

(This is the only type I will cover, because RA is fixed on this server)

400 Intelligence, Rest Strength



Advantages: High Magical Damage, High Protection, High HP, Best at PvP

Disadvantages: Low Defense, Can’t train at night even in Roahm 2/3 at higher levels



Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100+ / All Resistance 70+, 10+ HP Steal, 4+ EP Steal



Ouster Classes

Water Ouster

Ousters born with a more conservative & passive personalities that mimic the ways of Nizle, the Goddess of Water & Ice. Water Ousters warm & soothing touch can heal, cures evil curses &  revives fallen sisters. When in danger, Water Ouster’s soft clear water turns into sharp ice crystals that cut through even the toughest armors.



Advantages:

Healing & Resurrecting Capability

Heals Silver

Chances of Critical Magic: Critical Magic is a very powerful critical force that effects magic spells only. When this skill is at the maximum, spells have a high chance to knock back the enemy and do 250% the regular damage



Disadvantages:

Cannot Heal any status effect except Paralyze

Very Slow Game-Play: Since Waters do not have as many aggressive skills as a Fire Ouster, they usually end up struggling in leveling or grouping up with other Ousters to hasten their progress

No HP / EP Steal Capability: This makes it harder for water ousters to survive. Also, because they usually have low Intelligence & skills that have a high EP costs you will find yourself running out of EP quickly



Typical Water Ouster Builds



Non-RA Water Ouster

300 Intelligence, Rest Strength

(This is the only type I will cover, because RA is fixed on this server)



Advantages: High HP, High Protection

Disadvantages: Low EP, Slightly Lower Magical Damage



“Water Ousters are the Bishops of Ousters. They are very fun to play if you have the patience to get to 130 very slowly. Even after that leveling isn’t the greatest but Water Ousters are very powerful in the end. Having more than 300~400 Intelligence on any ouster is useless because Ousters need to focus on survivability more than damage.”



Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100+ / All Resistance 80+

Ouster Classes

Earth Ouster

Ousters who believed in tactics in the battle field followed the way of Gnome, the Goddess of Soil. These types of ousters use crippling magical & tactical fighting to slow down the enemy, bind them to the earth, or strike them with powerful boulders that weight tones.



Advantages:

Crippling Magic: The 140 Skill slows down everything by 50%, event attack & cast speed, a one of a kind skill

Can cast “Darkness”: Earth Elemental is the Ousters version of Darkness; sadly, it can be broken and has a very long delay until you can cast it, but it can protect you from single target skills

Reactive Armor: This is the main reason why people made Ousters. This skill reduces Physical & Magical Damage intake by 50% when mastered! It’s an amazing skill that make’s Earth Ousters a huge threat

Chances of Critical Magic: Critical Magic is a very powerful critical force that effects magic spells only. When this skill is at the maximum, spells have a high chance to knock back the enemy and do 250% the regular damage



Disadvantages:

Very Slow Game-Play: Since Earth Ousters do not have as many aggressive skills as a Fire Ouster, they usually end up struggling in leveling or grouping up with other Ousters to hasten their progress

No HP / EP Steal Capability: This makes it harder for water ousters to survive. Also, because they usually have low Intelligence & skills that have a high EP costs you will find yourself running out of EP quickly



Ouster Classes

Earth Ouster

Typical Earth Ouster Builds



Strength Based Earth Ouster

400 Intelligence, Rest Strength

(This is the only type I will cover, because RA is fixed on this server)



Advantages: High HP, High Protection, High Defense

Disadvantages: Low Defense, Can’t train at night even in Roahm 2/3 at higher levels



“Earth Ousters are another favorite alternative Ouster. They have great skills that cripple & help out in the battlefield. This Ouster is like the water Ouster, it requires some patience & levels quite slowly but with enough patience, this may be one of the enjoyable Ouster characters to play”



Hybrid Earth Ouster

(This is the only type I will cover, because RA is fixed on this server)

400 Intelligence, ½ Dexterity & ½ Strength (100/100. 150/150. 200/200)



Advantages: Good Magical Damage, Good Defense, Can be great at PvP & PvM, can train at harder areas at night

Disadvantages: - Requires High Level Players, Low HP, Low Protection



Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100+ / All Resistance 80+



Ouster Classes

Combat Ouster

Other Ousters saw how hard it was for their sisters to survive in the wilderness because of their fragile bodies. The Ousters were being outnumbered and overwhelmed by enemies who used weapons & brute force rather than magic.

They would be able to survive more & strike accurately to eliminate any threat if Ousters learned to use their nimble bodies to become agile & avoid these attacks.

These types of Ousters are the physical force of the Ouster race, they fight swiftly & are usually hard to target because they move so much. With the blessings of the other elements, these ousters can be blessed with other elemental bonuses depending on their Elemental Soul Stone formation.



Typical Combat Ousters Builds



Dexterity Based Combat Ouster - 100~200 Strength, Rest Dexterity

Advantages: High Defense, High To-Hit

Disadvantages:  Average Damage, Low HP, Very weak against Mage Enemies.



Strength Based Combat Ouster - 100~300 Dexterity, Rest Strength

Advantages: High Damage, High HP, High Protection

Disadvantages: Low To-Hit, Low Defense



“These Ousters are always fast paced. They are one of the most enjoyable melee classes because of the freedom of movement & attacks that have a large area of effect. Although melee type characters are not my type of characters I enjoyed them while I played with them. The HP and EP Steal capability is great and can make this type of Ouster more survivable than your average melee character”



Preferred Set

Curse Resistance 100 / All Resistance 60+, 10+ HP Steal, 3+EP Steal

Fighting Tips

Vampires can use hotkeys F5-F12, use them wisely and memories your skills

When fighting anyone, use Yellow Poison and darkness to hide your body an movements

When fighting healers, use Noose of Wrath to break through their Denial Magic that reduces most of your magical attacks

Conceal your body with Darkness & Grey Darkness always

Cast multiple Darkness to give decrease the chances of you being detected

Never stay in one spot

Always use death if you are a mage, this will make any resistance sets obsolete

If any curse spell fails, keep trying over the time you fight, your chances may be very low, but there is  still a chance to turn the tables

If you are running low on HP, summon gore gland, cast a darkness to conceal it, paralyze your gore gland and kill it, turn into a wolf and eat the invisible corpse

Demoralize your opponent by casting yellow poison, bloody walls and Darkness all in the battle field to show your enemy that you are dominating the area

To direct your Gore Gland to a certain position, use Set Afire or Bloody Sacrifice to push it in your desired direction

Ousters

Fire Ouster:

Hot Key Setup:

F7: Magnum Spear, Beat Head, Hell Fire, Fierce Flame

F8: Ring of Flare, Hands of Fire, Fire Elemental, Divine Spirits

F9: Refusal Ether, Tendril, Gnomes Whisper

F10: Teleport, Absorb Soul

F11: Summon Miga

F12: -

To cast prominence, you will have to press F8 to select Ring of Flare, and scroll down once.

(This is a professional move, if it is too complicated; use the F12 to hotkey Prominence)



Tips:

-Every skill requires Elemental Levels & a wristlet. Typically, the best type of set up is to have a Fire Wristlet (5 Fire Levels), 3 Level 5 Fire Stones, and 1 Level 5 Earth Stone. These items are very high level items and are found in high level areas like Asylum. Lower level elemental stones are commonly found according to the map level, they will give less elemental levels but at least you can cast your skills



-Refusal Ether requires 7 Earth Stones, so to clear darkness; you will have to replace one of your fire stones with an earth one. This means you will not be able to cast Hell fire or Fierce Flame, but clearing darkness and being to hit your enemy is your top priority so it is worth the sacrifice against Darkness spammers.



-When in a mob, use Fierce Flame, Hell Fire, and Prominence.

-Hell Fire has very low cool down, abuse it in the battle field



-If blinded, hold CAPSLOCK & click with the magnum spear skill, this will auto target the closest enemy, just hope it's the enemy you need to kill



-Use Beat Head after magnum spear to fill in the cool down of Magnum Spear



-The numbers 1-30 represent the skill level, 150 and 170 are the 150 and 170 skills
